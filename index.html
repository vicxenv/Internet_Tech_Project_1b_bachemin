                <p>My Story</p>
            <ol> For as long as I can remember, I've always been in love with creating art. I remember when I was about 4-years-old, 
                my parents bought me a little toy keyboard, and I used to jam away on that thing! I made my very first song on that same toy keyboard. 
                From that moment on, I knew I had a gift. 

 

                I began dancing around the age of 6 and shortly after immersed myself in competition cheerleading. Something about being in front of a crowd 
                and fully letting myself go really did call to me.
                
                 
                
                At the age of 8, I started participating in musical theater at a local community theater in my hometown. Musical theater became my heart beat. 
                It was my driver that kept me on my toes. It was the most freeing feeling in the world to step into a character and bring it to life. 
                
                 
                
                At the age of 16, I went to a modeling school, Barbizon USA, where I was trained in high fashion and commercial modeling. 
                I competed in modeling and acting competitions all throughout highschool while also booking my own freelance gigs and walking in New Orleans Fashion Week, and more.
                In my senior modeling competition, 
                I was offered a full scholarship to the New York Conservatory of Dramatic Arts and offered to sign with Creative Talent Management in New York City. 
                
                 
                
                Since then, I have been continuing my studies at Loyola University N.O. in Mass Communication and minoring in Music Industry Studies. I have immersed myself in so many different 
                genres of the creative scene - from dancing to acting, singing, modeling, cosmetology, digital production, and more, I truly understand what it means to be an artist and the dedication and passion that goes into it. 
                That is why my goal in life is to provide a platform for artists to express themselves while also helping them to develop, manage, and monetize their personal brand. </ol>

            <h1>Artist Episodes</h1>
            <p> Every creative has a story. Their journey's aren't always easy, but it is the story that helps to shape them into the true artists they are today.
                I believe everyone's voice should be heard and their stories should be told. Check out what these artists' stories and what they have to say about 
                about navigating through the industry!
